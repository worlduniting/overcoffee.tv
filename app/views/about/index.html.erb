        <h4>Why did I create this show?</h4>
        <p>This whole project came about from a question that has caused an ongoing internal struggle for me...In our global community, how do we learn to peacefully live together with fundamental differences in how we view God, life, purpose, and morals?</p>

        <p>I decided to launch this show, as a program of <%= link_to "World Uniting", "http://www.worlduniting.org", :target => "_blank" %>, called Over Coffee where I could seek to address this very question head-on by listening to the spiritual stories of people from all walks of life and spirituality, in a casual setting over coffee.</p>

        <p>Each episode features a new guest. The interview is broken into three sections: (1) Spiritual heritage and early life, (2) Major life events that have shaped their spirituality, (3) and relevant issues with which they are currently engaging or wrestling.</p>

        <p>Each episode is filmed on location with a minimal studio setup, utilizing a GoPro wide-angle camera, H6 Digital Recorder with Mid-Side mic and lapels mix-down, and minimal box lighting as necessary.</p>

        <p>I do hope you enjoy this show. I have already learned so much. It has been an overwhelming honor to have my guests trust me to share their stories with you. Please do let me know if there are ways that you think I might improve the show, the questions I ask, or the way I part my hair.</p>

        <p>Rev. Dave</p>
