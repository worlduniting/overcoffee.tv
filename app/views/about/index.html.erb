        <h4>Why did we create this show?</h4>
        <p>Rev. Dave began wrestling with this question...In our global community, how do we learn to peacefully live together with fundamental differences in how we view God, life, purpose, and morals?</p>

        <p>He decided to create a new show, as a program of <%= link_to "World Uniting", "http://www.worlduniting.org", :target => "_blank" %>, called Over Coffee where he could seek to address this very question head-on by championing empathy through listening to the spiritual stories of people from all walks of life and spirituality, in a casual setting over coffee.</p>

        <p>Each episode features a new guest. The interview is broken into three sections: (1) Spiritual heritage and early life, (2) Major life events that have shaped their spirituality, (3) and relevant issues with which they are currently engaging or wrestling.</p>

        <p>Each episode is filmed on location with a minimal studio setup, utilizing a GoPro wide-angle camera, H6 Digital Recorder with Mid-Side mic and lapels mix-down, and minimal box lighting as necessary.</p>
