        <p>Rev. Dave Thompson is the host of Over Coffee, an itinerate pastor and is the best-selling author of “Over Coffee.” Dave is an internationally sought after radio and television personality, public speaker and contributing columnist for
        <a href="http://www.christianpost.com">The Christian Post.</a>
        Dave is also the co-founder and CMO of
        <a href="http://worlduniting.org">World Uniting</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the intersection of faith and cultural conflict, Dave brings a discerning understanding of faith and social issues that are theological and culturally relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
        Born Catholic, Dave's family eventually found themselves in an Assemblies of God church in Missoula, Montana. Dave left to begin his ministerial studies at
        <a href="http://www.trinitybiblecollege.edu/">Trinity Bible College,</a>
        an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblies_of_God">Assemblies of God</a>
        school in North Dakota. While there Dave toured throughout the Midwest speaking and performing in Churches, taking his first interim music and pastor position for a large church in Montana at the age of nineteen. Completing his ministerial degree, focusing on religion and philosophy, at
        <a href="http://www.northwestu.edu/">Northwest University</a>
        in Washington State, Dave also competed on one of the top five debating teams in the US, all the while continuing to work in music and teaching ministries, pastoring for a short time in Corvallis, Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>
        Dave went on to study at
        <a href="http://www.gordonconwell.edu/">Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary</a>
        and, through the Boston Theological Institute, studying Religion & Social Conflict, taking much of his studies at
        <a href="http://www.ants.edu/">Andover-Newton</a>
        and
        <a href="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/">Harvard Divinity School.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        While in Boston studying, Dave came to a crossroads where he decided that he could no longer pursue ministry and teaching until he was able to rectify the seeming contradiction between his biblical faith and his sexual orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
        Taking a sabbatical from his theological education and ministry, Dave spent the next few years consulting with state, national, and international political campaigns concerning faith and cultural issues. Dave also discovered he had a knack for web-software development and so found himself working in entrepreneurship, web technology startups, and with Fortune 500 companies to develop globally targeted web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        Returning to his ministerial calling, Dave launched his first book, addressing one of his own faith-family's biblically and culturally conflicting issues; fashioning a new take on the gay issue. Dave takes a unique approach with his book,
        <a href="/writings">Over Coffee,</a>
        presenting a case for holding gay couples within a similar framework in which the Bible embraces any other unchangeable human circumstances. Dave presents gay couples within their equal participation in God's intention for companionship, in the welcoming and enabling grace of the Body of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to his writing and speaking, Dave consults with organizations and leaders who are facing conflicts concerning faith and culture. Dave brings a compelling grasp of his own Christian heritage, offering relevant faith reflections on a number of front-burner religiously and culturally conflicting issues. His audiences continue to walk away with an engaging acquaintance, challenging their horizons with conversation.
